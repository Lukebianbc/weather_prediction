#### This is my project about weather prediction.There are CSV files that include historical weather data for 5 cities over a span of 15 months. They include weather readings on an hourly basis that include humidity (in %), pressure (in hPa), temperature (in K), weather disposition, wind direction (in meteorological degrees), and wind speed (in m/s). we want to provide a statistical model that estimates the weather in these 5 cities for the given time based on the readings in the file July4test.csv. The output should be the estimated temperature and weather disposition as a simple txt file. Also, I write some limits about my model and how to improve my performance of my model.
